                <p>All Saint's Day Family Reunion<span class="date">7/19/2023</span></p>
                <p>
                    During the small vacation week leading up to the All Soul's and All Saints Day, our family visited 
                    our relatives from Luzon in order to visit Dad's hometown, Gapan. After a long tenuos trip coming 
                    from Negros to Manila, from arriving in Baguio at 4 am and staying and enjoying the view with
                    my nieces and my uncle, who provided us with his apartment, to going to Gapan early at 6 am 
                    in the morning and meeting my cousins finally for the first time in a long time in their house.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Although we finally arrived at the place and had a heartfelt reunion with them, we still had one 
                    more activity to do before leaving back to Dumaguete. We visited the graves of our grandfathers and 
                    grandmothers. It was the first time I ever met Dad's and my uncle's ancestors. Dad introduced to
                    me those whose graves we were visiting to. Though I kinda forgot about it due to it being a little
                    bit complex for me to remember, I still appreciated where my family came from.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Reflecting on this event, I realized that death is an inevitable part of life. Even if we try to 
                    run away from it, at some point later in life, we would be tired of running away from it and that 
                    the things that we have loved in life have soon disappeared. Death and decay is an extant of life.
                    Yet, even with this, what matters most in one's life is not how one dies, but rather how he sets
                    his teachings and his impacts to those around him.
                    <br/><br/>
                    After writing this reflection, I still missed my cousins and the time I spent with them. Sure, its
                    quite short, it was a very meaningful experience for me. May I meet them once more before I leave
                    the earth.

                <p>Family Rosary<span class="date">7/19/2023</span></p>
                <p>
                    I had organized my family’s evening rosary session. Although it was planned by our family to do this 
                    every night for the entire month to commemorate our Mother Mary’s month, we had found it hard due to 
                    the works that we had to deal with in our academe and in the workplace. Thankfully, as I organized 
                    our family’s session, everyone was ready for it.<br/><br/>

                    As we went with the prayer, I realized how happy, beautiful and simple one’s life is when one is 
                    young and when one is free from worries and stresses of the future. I was even reminded that even if 
                    it seems our parents really hates us, the mystery of the finding of Jesus in the temple and the 
                    mystery of Mother Mary visiting her cousin Elizabeth constantly reminded us of how our parents loved 
                    us, and will still continue, even if we falter from the family.<br/><br/>

                    We ended our session with a bid of goodnight to each other. In the course of the rosary, we hadn’t 
                    known that we were bonding over each other and forgetting about the responsibilities that we must do 
                    for our work to be finished. It acts as some sort of a stress free time; a time that we can be free 
                    and to remember the love that we gave. We went back to our work as I blew off the candle

                <p>Wake of my Mom's friend from Dipolog <span class="date">8/22/2023</span></p>
                <p>
                    We went immediately to Dipolog after catching wind that her friend is having a wake. Catching the
                    6 AM trip to Dipolog, we traveled from Dumaguete to Dapitan port with the basic necessities. We didnt
                    bring our car this time, unlike the other trips that we had like going to Cebu, to Dauin, to Bacolod, 
                    and vice versa. We were able to secure a ticket in the hot sunny afternoon of the same day.
                    <br/><br/>
                    We arrived at a new Dapitan City in the dead of night. After getting one of the fastest midnight rides 
                    I have ever seen in a pedicab going to Dipolog City, we arrived at a not-too-shabby inn. Even if it is 
                    midnight, thankfully a staff member was up in the lobby and helped us in our rooms. We slept in what
                    one can call a box peacefully throughout the night. We woke up and prepared ourselves for the wake. We
                    went to a nearby Mcdonalds to eat breakfast there, then roam around Dipolog proper to see what had 
                    changed when we were gone.
                    <br/><br/>
                    We went to the wake that her friend is in. Well, where her friend was. We went to the room where the 
                    wake was taking place and saw her, aged, sleeping peacefully in the coffin and ready to go back to the
                    earth once more. Emotional, Mom was starting to tear up from all the memories she had with her. It has
                    been a long time since they have been together, starting from when they were in high school. Her family
                    was grieving along with her. A good friend has died. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    Before she started working hard, Mom and her had met each other everytime she visits in Dumaguete. I
                    couldnt imagine how it went, but it was surely beautiful to reunite again. Suddenly, Mom and her had
                    started to fall out, due to the fact that Mom kept ignoring her requests to meet when she came to
                    Dumaguete. This event was the last time they will ever meet.
                    <br/><br/>
                    As the angelic voices of the funeral choir sing along with all her friends and family that she had made
                    during her time here, I realized that the friends I have made are very important. They shouldnt be 
                    ignored and shouldnt be pushed away, all because of some bureucratic and capitalist responsibilities.
                    Instead, we must make space for them in our lives, even if we work. Who knows? It may be the last time
                    that we ever see them and enjoy life with them again. It may very well be the last adventure that they
                    have, and you arent there, you know?
                    <br/><br/>
                    Man, I miss my friends and the things I have and could've done with them. May I see them again in the
                    future.
