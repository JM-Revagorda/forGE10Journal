                I had organized my family’s evening rosary session. Although it was planned by our family to do this 
                every night for the entire month to commemorate our Mother Mary’s month, we had found it hard due to 
                the works that we had to deal with in our academe and in the workplace. Thankfully,...

                The mass that we had attended was the last mass for the liturgical year, as we are entering the days celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ and of the rebirth of the liturgical year. During the homily, I realized that even if you believe in Him, it is still merely a sequence of words just spoken from your mouth. In order to truly believe and to follow Him, one must be good unto others. Even if they are of different religions, different places, different attitudes, and of different upbringings, one must have the compassion to do good to them, and have the generosity to help their problems. After typing this one, I realize that the lesson that the priest gave us is a little bit interesting to think about.<br/><br/>
As we are going into the season of giving, so shall we try to give something back to those who continued to care for us and to those living in unfortunate circumstances.

                I had organized my family’s evening rosary session. Although it was planned by our family to do this 
                every night for the entire month to commemorate our Mother Mary’s month, we had found it hard due to 
                the works that we had to deal with in our academe and in the workplace. Thankfully, as I organized 
                our family’s session, everyone was ready for it.<br/><br/>

                As we went with the prayer, I realized how happy, beautiful and simple one’s life is when one is 
                young and when one is free from worries and stresses of the future. I was even reminded that even if 
                it seems our parents really hates us, the mystery of the finding of Jesus in the temple and the 
                mystery of Mother Mary visiting her cousin Elizabeth constantly reminded us of how our parents loved 
                us, and will still continue, even if we falter from the family.<br/><br/>

                We ended our session with a bid of goodnight to each other. In the course of the rosary, we hadn’t 
                known that we were bonding over each other and forgetting about the responsibilities that we must do 
                for our work to be finished. It acts as some sort of a stress free time; a time that we can be free 
                and to remember the love that we gave. We went back to our work as I blew off the candle
