                    and that there are local shops selling their products of their businesses. Some of them are new, while some of them are

                <p>Sunrise Mass and Devotion <span class="date">12/6/2023</span></p>
                <p>
                    This sunrise devotion was hosted by the PEP Advisers. They will give the rice that each of our groups in every section
                    gave to the security guards as a way of giving them thanks for keeping our campus protected. I was one of those who 
                    gave their rice to these security guards as a Christmas gift from our school. There was a devotion at the start, then
                    the giving of gifts, where all present PEP students, including me, were to be in front of the stage, giving each guard 
                    their respective rice and goods that the PEP teachers has prepared. After that, we had a small active Zumba given to 
                    us by the Psychology students. Then, after the activity, we got our breakfasts before departing immediately, as we
                    are not allowed to eat in the Ampitheater.
                    <br><br>
                    Before I got there, I was thinking that the devotion will still be the same like the liturgical masses of SU Church. 
                    Moreover, I was expecting that I would find a place to eat my breakfast, as in ROTC, we never had a meal to start
                    the day with in there. However, the entire activity was both surprising and inspiring. The lecture was about the gift
                    of giving, as we are in the month of Christmas. Although we have the ability to hurt, we can also have the ability to 
                    give.
                    <br><br>
                    I could be able to use this by understanding first the situation that others are experiencing in order to better help 
                    them, then I can give them some help, in forms of actions, financially, and other basic necessities. It can be through
                    a simple outreach constructed by a group I can formed, or it can be like how my Dad does it, treating the poor 
                    children to eat with us in a fast food restaurant.
                    <br><br>
                    Because of this activity, I have become more aware of the lives of others, most especially those who are living in
                    marginalized conditions.

                    Room.
                    <br><br>
                    As per usual, I am neutral in my expectations, however I was piqued at the creativity of the group I am in. Even if
                    the other groups' gifts were more elaborate, gigantic, and more decorative than ours, I was deeply impressed that
                    we could do more with just a paper bag, glue, tape, and a stack of different colored construction paper. Moreover,
                    we tried to make it really special for the children by including Hunt's Baked Beans and some candies for them, as it
                    was the Christmas season and they deserve more.
                    <br><br>
                    This activity helped me understand that even if we have not much things to have for them, it is still important that
                    we still give them. After all, we have the power to give, right? This activity helped me learn to inculcate the
                    power of giving by making our gifts special, even with limited resources, just like the activity that we have now.
                    <br><br>
                    Because of this activity, I had fun and I was able to help my groupmates output a creative idea for the gifts that will 
                    be given to the children in the orphanage.

                <p>Interview and Outreach to Parking Attendants in SU <span class="date">12/12/2023</span></p>
                <p>
                    This activity was made by our group for a final CHS project relating to the message of Exodus. Our targeted demographic
                    was the parking attendants of SU who were toiling under the cold rain and under the burning sun in order to help us 
                    arrange the motorcycles in the parking areas. This activity was done on Wednesday afternoon during the finals week.
                    <br><br>
                    Before deciding to do this activity, I was actively curious on the lives of the parking attendants here in SU. Some of 
                    them lived alone, while others have a family that are staying where their fathers are working in, while others are 
                    also living as a couple. When I get to hear them for the first time, I was deeply astonished as to how hard being 
                    as a parking attendant is. They sometimes earn P600 to almost none at all in a day. They dont even earn anything during 
                    the holidays, as there are no students who can give them the money they need to buy for their food everyday. Even the 
                    prices of commodities will at times be more expensive that what they can afford. Although we couldnt help them 
                    financially, we gave them instead our prepared white gifts that has some canned goods, snacks, and even instant noodles.
                    Although we only gave to 3 parking attendants the white gifts, at least we have learned how a marginalized person lives,
                    and at least gave them a little Christmas to enjoy.
                    <br><br>
                    This activity helped me value my family's financial standing more. In order to treasure the gift that I was born in, I
                    will try my best to save by not buying useless things or not buying a lot of necessities, but rather to buy the things
                    that we really do need in moderation, as there are others who really needed the thing that you were buying the most.
                    I must also help give something back to those who are working in poor people's jobs by either creating another outreach,
                    joining one, or by being generous to them through giving of money, or through giving of food.
                    <br><br>
                    Because of this activity, I have a new understanding of how a poor man's life is and how fortunate I am to have all the
                    things that I touch and have today.

                <p>IBP Christmas Bazaar <span class="date">12/5/2023</span></p>
                <p>
                    This activity was hosted by the legal company IBP Dumaguete inside the Hall of Justice. It was a whole day activity
                    and that there are local shops selling their products of their businesses. Some of them are new, while some of them are
                    well-established businesses here in Dumaguete. I came inside the Hall to see the event.
                    <br><br>
                    In the event, I noticed that it is not only the businesses who are having the bazaar. Up on the floors above, there are 
                    doors that led to miniature courtrooms and legal companies who allow people to enter. Inside these offices and courtrooms, 
                    there were jelly beans, cupcakes, sweet bread, and even ice cream, if you are lucky. Normally, one couldnt enter these 
                    rooms, as you need an appointment to enter. It was a surprising and somewhat magical experience. With all the decorations
                    there, the entire Hall felt so Christmassy compared to the other events I entered this month.
                    <br><br>
                    This activity helped me become more inspired to spread the Christmas spirit by being welcoming and friendly to others, in 
                    the way that I talk to them, to how my room looks like, to even giving the joy I have to others through generosity or
                    through the things that I do. Even helping them is another way to go.
                    <br><br>
                    Because of this activity, I had my spirit uplifted and enlightened by the spirit of Christmas.
