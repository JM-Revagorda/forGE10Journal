                    During the competition, I realized a lot of things. First, in order to properly fight someone, you must 
                    know the army that you are fighting with. It was late that I realized this when I had to ask the

                <p>
                        During the competition, I realized a lot of things. First, in order to properly fight someone, you must 
                        know the army that you are fighting with. It was late that I realized this when I had to ask the 
                        owner of the deck I just borrowed for the competition as it has a specific ability I have never heard of
                        before. And also because I am not familiar with the deck itself, I wasnt able to beat my enemy up close yet.
                        Second, I realize that I must not waste the resources that I have. Why spend so much on trying not to get hit
                        by my opponent's blow when I couldnt even try to rack up as much power as I can during my turn? Thirdly,
                        I realize that my excitement, my fear, and my hesitation can break the game that I have. I know that I am
                        an emotional guy, but letting my emotions get in the way in the fight can actually hinder me from seeing my
                        opponent's weakness.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        But most of all, I learn to have fun, even if I keep losing. Although I was a bit envious that almost all of my 
                        colleagues got to the final rounds, I was able to still be proud that I was in a tournament for the first time.
                        As I witness the glory that was the final round, I still remind myself why I still love the game.

                <p>
                    It was a pretty cool day that time. I was walking down the college when I looked at the room at my left. There were students that were playing there. Curious, I entered it, and 
                    found myself in the Leaderboard competition. There were people playing OSU, Flappy Bird, and even Minesweeper. Due to the fact, that most of the places were being filled in by 
                    various people, I decided to go to the computers with OSU! turned on. Weird thing is that not most people are playing it, other than the games that were really common to them, 
                    and somewhat boring to watch (basing on my own opinion). Even weirder thing is that I dont even know how to play OSU! in the first place. All I could think about was having fun 
                    that day. So, I went to one of the computers, and played the tutorial. With the help of my tablet displaying the helpful guide on how to beat OSU! levels (called beatmaps), I 
                    headed on to the main event. Like many others who just started playing a game, I played onto the easiest level in the game. Though there were lots of things happening on screen 
                    at once, I was able to pull off my rhythmic gamer attitude and got through it.<br/>
                    <br/>After continuous gaming, I gained some confidence in playing harder versions of the levels(mostly normal mode). Man, they definitely kicked my ass, but at least they definitely 
                    taught me that knowing every nook and cranny of every song will help you to survive each level, well except for several songs that are considered unpredictable and noise-like. 
                    After an hour of playing them, I wrote my name, my accuracy, and my score on a piece of paper dedicated to those who played OSU!, thinking that its for the attendance of the 
                    Leaderboard event. Then, I left in a haste towards my house as it was already lunch time.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    I realize that even in the lowest points in my life, when I feel that I couldnt do the thing that I wanted, I must always remember that I am still good at something.

                <p>ROTC Speech Contest<span class="date">8/14/2023</span></p>
                <p>
                    When I watched the contest with my platoon, I noticed that almost of the contestants are not really
                    ready for the competition. Some of them were blatantly making their speech "relational" by speaking
                    out against ROTC, which is actually against the rules (Im also inclined to be against them too, but
                    in a way that its subtle and not clearly seen). Other people have paused at parts, breaking the
                    continuity of the speeches that they had. While others have a heavy accent that destroys the meaning
                    of what they are saying in front of us all. Only one of them clearly had won the contest.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    However, putting away my criticism against most of the contestants, I have to applaud at their 
                    bravery to put up a speech to be spoken to everyone around Luce Auditorium. Such courage, even if
                    unprepared, I have not seen. If I were there and I havent readied my speech yet, my nervousness will
                    be shown in the voice that Im carrying.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    There is no such thing as "fearless", as to have fear is to be human. Rather, it is the courage and
                    bravery one has in order to push through against the challenges one faces.

                <p>Tekken Tournament <span class="date">8/21/2023</span></p>
                <p>
                    The Tekken Tournament was an event held in the Robinson's Atrium area. I was watching the 
                    e-sports tournament while talking to one of my friends, who was one of those going to fight.
                    <br/><br/>
                    My initial expectations were low to none, knowing that most people wouldn't want to watch
                    the fights as they, like my father, view them as "children's games", something that to this
                    day, still insulted me. When I viewed it for the first time, I was in lost for words. Unlike
                    the button mashing that normally people do when playing in arcades, these people had learned
                    the art of knowing their fighter and what they could do. Moreover, they dont just button-mash.
                    They literally know what is the right time for them to counter someone head on.
                    <br/><br/>
                    This tournament had gave me some confidence that I can be a good fighter like them, in gaming
                    and in actual fights. The event taught me that when in fights, I must know what I could do
                    and what my enemy could do, how I can achieve my goal of defeating my enemy, to not let my
                    emotions get in the way, and to have patience in order to see a person's weak spot.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Because of this activity, I have renewed my confidence to continue to train my fighting skills
                    so that when the time comes when it is needed, I am ready.

                <p>
                    The meet ran from October 18-19 of 2023. Various competitors ranging from a team from Dauin all the
                    way to our own local team from Dumaguete. I was there watching the children's competition in Shaw 
                    Memorial pool in the morning.
                    <br/><br/>
                    What striked me in the competition was that these children, most particularly girls, were able to swim 
                    fast while being more effective in their techniques in order to conserve their energy. Also, the pool
                    was really long, meaning that children at their age will grow tired of swimming and will need the help 
                    of the lifeguard. Even when the pool is long, I was surprised that they managed to get to the end 
                    of the pool, even without the help of a lifeguard.

                    This event had taught me that in life, I have to have the determination to see things through to the end,
                    no matter how tiring they can be. Just like the children in the pool, I too can find a way to finish 
                    things when I started it, while being badass at that.
                    <br/><br/>
                    This event helped me have determination, and I will keep watching these events in the future.
