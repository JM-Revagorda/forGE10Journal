                    During the competition, I realized a lot of things. First, in order to properly fight someone, you must 
                    know the army that you are fighting with. It was late that I realized this when I had to ask the

                    It was a pretty cool day that time. I was walking down the college when I looked at the room at my left. There were students that were playing there. Curious,
                    I entered it, and found myself in the Leaderboard competition. There were people playing OSU, Flappy Bird, and even Minesweeper. Due to the fact, that...

                    When I watched the contest with my platoon, I noticed that almost of the contestants are not really

                <p>
                        During the competition, I realized a lot of things. First, in order to properly fight someone, you must 
                        know the army that you are fighting with. It was late that I realized this when I had to ask the 
                        owner of the deck I just borrowed for the competition as it has a specific ability I have never heard of
                        before. And also because I am not familiar with the deck itself, I wasnt able to beat my enemy up close yet.
                        Second, I realize that I must not waste the resources that I have. Why spend so much on trying not to get hit
                        by my opponent's blow when I couldnt even try to rack up as much power as I can during my turn? Thirdly,
                        I realize that my excitement, my fear, and my hesitation can break the game that I have. I know that I am
                        an emotional guy, but letting my emotions get in the way in the fight can actually hinder me from seeing my
                        opponent's weakness.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        But most of all, I learn to have fun, even if I keep losing. Although I was a bit envious that almost all of my 
                        colleagues got to the final rounds, I was able to still be proud that I was in a tournament for the first time.
                        As I witness the glory that was the final round, I still remind myself why I still love the game.

                <p>
                    It was a pretty cool day that time. I was walking down the college when I looked at the room at my left. There were students that were playing there. Curious, I entered it, and 
                    found myself in the Leaderboard competition. There were people playing OSU, Flappy Bird, and even Minesweeper. Due to the fact, that most of the places were being filled in by 
                    various people, I decided to go to the computers with OSU! turned on. Weird thing is that not most people are playing it, other than the games that were really common to them, 
                    and somewhat boring to watch (basing on my own opinion). Even weirder thing is that I dont even know how to play OSU! in the first place. All I could think about was having fun 
                    that day. So, I went to one of the computers, and played the tutorial. With the help of my tablet displaying the helpful guide on how to beat OSU! levels (called beatmaps), I 
                    headed on to the main event. Like many others who just started playing a game, I played onto the easiest level in the game. Though there were lots of things happening on screen 
                    at once, I was able to pull off my rhythmic gamer attitude and got through it.<br/>
                    <br/>After continuous gaming, I gained some confidence in playing harder versions of the levels(mostly normal mode). Man, they definitely kicked my ass, but at least they definitely 
                    taught me that knowing every nook and cranny of every song will help you to survive each level, well except for several songs that are considered unpredictable and noise-like. 
                    After an hour of playing them, I wrote my name, my accuracy, and my score on a piece of paper dedicated to those who played OSU!, thinking that its for the attendance of the 
                    Leaderboard event. Then, I left in a haste towards my house as it was already lunch time.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    I realize that even in the lowest points in my life, when I feel that I couldnt do the thing that I wanted, I must always remember that I am still good at something.

                <p>
                    When I watched the contest with my platoon, I noticed that almost of the contestants are not really
                    ready for the competition. Some of them were blatantly making their speech "relational" by speaking
                    out against ROTC, which is actually against the rules (Im also inclined to be against them too, but
                    in a way that its subtle and not clearly seen). Other people have paused at parts, breaking the
                    continuity of the speeches that they had. While others have a heavy accent that destroys the meaning
                    of what they are saying in front of us all. Only one of them clearly had won the contest.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    However, putting away my criticism against most of the contestants, I have to applaud at their 
                    bravery to put up a speech to be spoken to everyone around Luce Auditorium. Such courage, even if
                    unprepared,
