                    It was a pretty cool day that time. I was walking down the college when I looked at the room at my left. There were students that were playing there. Curious,
                    I entered it, and found myself in the Leaderboard competition. There were people playing OSU, Flappy Bird, and even Minesweeper. Due to the fact, that...

                        It was a pretty hectic day. After dealing with my ROTC and my family's house cleaning day, I had to rush out of my house using my 
                bike, as the competition will begin at 1pm, and the call time is about before 12nn. I had to prepare everything just before I leave. It 
                was a really stressful time, as if was going too continue on with my cleaning, and eat at home, I would definitely not be joining the 
                competition. And the thing is, there's a lot of things that are left really messy inside our own house. Even the water ejected from the 
                washing machine was spewing outwards from the hole towards the sewers we usually dump it in. It turned out that there was a second 
                hidden plastic that was used to cover it that was blocking all the water going out of it. I had to absorb and scoop out the water 
                from the area as this may cause more problems for me later on.

                    It was a pretty cool day that time. I was walking down the college when I looked at the room at my left. There were students that were playing there. Curious, I entered it, and 
                    found myself in the Leaderboard competition. There were people playing OSU, Flappy Bird, and even Minesweeper. Due to the fact, that most of the places were being filled in by 
                    various people, I decided to go to the computers with OSU! turned on. Weird thing is that not most people are playing it, other than the games that were really common to them, 
                    and somewhat boring to watch (basing on my own opinion). Even weirder thing is that I dont even know how to play OSU! in the first place. All I could think about was having fun 
                    that day. So, I went to one of the computers, and played the tutorial. With the help of my tablet displaying the helpful guide on how to beat OSU! levels (called beatmaps), I 
                    headed on to the main event. Like many others who just started playing a game, I played onto the easiest level in the game. Though there were lots of things happening on screen 
                    at once, I was able to pull off my rhythmic gamer attitude and got through it.<br/>
                    <br/>After continuous gaming, I gained some confidence in playing harder versions of the levels(mostly normal mode). Man, they definitely kicked my ass, but at least they definitely 
                    taught me that knowing every nook and cranny of every song will help you to survive each level, well except for several songs that are considered unpredictable and noise-like. 
                    After an hour of playing them, I wrote my name, my accuracy, and my score on a piece of paper dedicated to those who played OSU!, thinking that its for the attendance of the 
                    Leaderboard event. Then, I left in a haste towards my house as it was already lunch time.
