                    Held in 145 Cafe by Yu-Ha prints, this orientation teaches one on the process of making a sticker, the nuances of the

                <p>Freshman Committee Orientation <span class="date">8/16/2023</span></p>
                <p>
                    After our GE10 Subject Orientation had ended, several seniors went up the stage. They were the representatives of the 
                    committees that made up our college's Confederate Council of Committees. I watched the introduction of each member and
                    committee as they produced some of the most interesting advertisements on what their respective committees do. Some of
                    them have long descriptions on their powerpoints on what their committee can do, while others have their own unique 
                    style of portraying the responsibilities and roles of the committee in an unprofessional, though rather funny and 
                    relational, way. While others just say it in front of us, also telling the truth of what they do.
                    <br><br>
                    The entire program ran like a prepared show in front of us. As they told us the responsibilities of each committee,
                    I noticed that each committee has different roles and inclinations. In the Aesthetics Committee, they help in 
                    producing some of the most elaborate designs for every event CCS has to offer. In the Transportation Committee, 
                    their aim is to check on what is needed by the other committees and to order and transport those goods or equipment to
                    them or to the location where the event is held. While in the Administratice Committee, their responsibilities is to
                    deliver messages or documents made by the Dean and her secretaries to other departments. Yet, even with all of this,
                    they still need each other in order to be effective in what they need to do. Even if they have nothing to do, they try 
                    to help the other committees in what they are doing, such as Administrative Committee helping the Aesthetics Committee 
                    in making the props for an event, etc.
                    <br><br>
                    Although this doesnt seem much, this helped me appreciate more how they still need each other even if they are in 
                    different spectrums.
                    <br><br>
                    This activity helped me understand that college life is not only about studies, but also making the most out of life and
                    to explore more on what you could do.

                <p>
                    This event was an introduction to the PEP classes that the PEP teachers will be holding after the Founder's Week.
                    I was one of those who are sitting along the circle with those who have scheduled this activity.
                    <br><br>
                    This activity was eye-opening, as I have met for the first time, my college mates in the department. It was a fun
                    experience. As I get to know each one of them, I have learnt the characteristics of each person I have met in the
                    activity. I always believed that college was an introduction to a boring and unfriendly life, yet here I am, 
                    dancing around with the people who I will soon call "friends" and "colleagues".
                    <br><br>
                    This activity taught me that there is so much to learn about in life. It is not only to merely become successful in 
                    life, but also rather to enjoy what life has to offer, even if I lose.
                    <br><br>
                    Because of this activity, this had opened my eyes to the college life.

                <p>
                    This event was hosted by the College of Computer Studies featuring the speaker, Mr. Ernest Dale M. Acar, who owns a company that creates content
                    for their client's FB pages and proves that programming, art, and stories can come together. I participated the lecture
                    as a student, as I dont have any role in this lecture. However, I did answer some questions that he had during the lecture.
                    <br><br>
                    His lecture taught me many things. His lecture taught me that the right mindset can make anything possible. He also 
                    taught us that the right strategy such as a change in habits in order to accomplish more in the work that we do.
                    And lastly, he taught us that we should enjoy the work, as it can help us gain a good mindset and a good strategy to 
                    overcome the difficulties that programming can happen.
                    <br><br>
                    I will use this teaching in my programming by taking breaks from time to time in order to start the work fresh. Then,
                    I will utilize time-management techniques in order to accomplish my goal faster. But ultimately, I have to remember
                    the joy of having a program or website to work, and the reason as to why I am here in the first place.
                    <br><br>
                    This lecture had helped me boost my motivation and my inspiration that art and coding can come together

                    <br><br>
                    What surprised me in the orientation that unlike the calm and collective marketing of the other NSTP groups, the ROTC
                    were seemingly the most obnoxious, in a sense that it tries to make itself higher and mightier than the other NSTP
                    groups. It threw me off, and even supported the sole reason why I dislike the military. Putting it aside, I did learn
                    something in the orientation. To succeed in something, one must not only have the money, love, or teamwork to do it,
                    but rather the right attitude in order to pull off a feat. Like how the LTS members care for the disabled, the CWTS
                    deal in community projects, and the ROTC deal with on-ground tactical strategies, having the right mindset, attitude,
                    and discipline can make the world go round as intended.
                    <br><br>
                    This orientation helped me learn that sometimes, discipline and compassion towards one's work can help one persevere
                    through every problem that they may face. Things like continuing to find the solutions of a math problem, asking
                    help from others who faced the same situation, and being brave enough to face the problem I have now are things like 
                    that. And because of this orientation, I have learnt to persevere through the right attitude.

                <p>All-University Convocation <span class="date">8/6/2023</span></p>
                <p>
                    The All-University Convocation was held in the morning inside the Luce-Auditorium. It was about the Student Government 
                    of SU introducing to freshmen like me on what are the services that they have to offer, such as dorm housing, 
                    international affairs for foreign students, physical, spiritual, and wellness services, and even legal affairs whenever
                    something bad happens to the student.
                    <br><br>
                    Unlike the other activities, where I dont normally expect anything, I was thinking that the convocation is just merely
                    a very long boring lecture, just like the SUCCI meetings that I and my Dad had attended in Luce. However, I was caught
                    in surprise that it was energetic and interesting, highlighted by the introductory acting done by some performing arts
                    students on the various services that Silliman has to offer; it was like an ad that is placed during commercial break,
                    but this time on the stage. During the main program, I was visited and appalled by the informative videos that they 
                    have made for this convocation. Although it seemed subpar compared to the ads that TV channels has to offer, it was 
                    interesting enough for me to understand fully what they can do for the students. For sure, some were just powerpoints
                    and lecture, but the convocation had interested me enough to understand how it could go.
                    <br><br>
                    This activity emphasized to me that schools are a second home, in a sense that they deal with the lodging, with the 
                    loans, and even the legal activities that can help put disagreements at bay. Thus, this orientation had helped me
                    understand the complexity and inner workings of Silliman's Student Government and helped me appreciate more on the
                    various tasks that they have to deal with.

                <p>Sticker-Verse Sticker Making Orientation <span class="date">8/11/2023</span></p>
                <p>
                    Held in 145 Cafe by Yu-Ha prints, this orientation teaches one on the process of making a sticker, the nuances of the 
                    different materials to be used to make the sticker, and the other things that one has to consider first before 
                    deciding to sell and make the stickers. I was the audience in this lecture.
                    <br><br>
                    I learned a lot of things from the lecture when it comes to sticker making. One is that it is a delecate process, as it
                    requires some materials like a laminator, a sticker printer, a mat where you could cut the stickers, a sticker page, and
                    others. More over, I learned on the various tips and tricks in order to be effective when cutting your stickers, like
                    making an outer outline away from the main drawing so that you can have a guide when you cut them for selling.
                    <br><br>
                    Although this may be an expensive hobby to deal with, the cost cannot be compared when you have the heart and the want to
                    make the stickers. Thus, the right attitude, material, and preparedness must come into mind when making these stickers.
                    This activity helped me understand better on making stickers, and have taught me that if you have the heart(and the money)
                    to do it, than nothing can stop you from showing to others your ideas.

                <p>PEP Class <span class="date">8/25/2023</span></p>
                <p>
                    This is a subject that I was in that tries to introduce to us the concepts of mental health and spiritual awareness.
                    It also acts as some sort of safe haven, away from the pressures that the other subjects gave us, even if it is minor.
                    <br><br>
                    Before this subject happened, I was thinking it would be just like the other subjects that we have. It would involve a
                    pretty long lecture, an assignment, and a quiz. To my surprise, none of those happened! It felt like I was in a dream,
                    most especially during their activities, as it is activity based. Moreover, everything is not graded! Being there felt
                    surreal and refreshing, as it was not normal for me to be in such a relaxing environment. But, even with the subject 
                    being activity-based, it still taught us that our mental and spiritual health is more important than the work 
                    and assignments that we have to do.
                    <br><br>
                    This subject had taught me to take care of myself along the way. Things like treating oneself every now and then, 
                    enjoying the activities that one has with others, practicing one’s faith, and the like are some of these things that
                    PEP had taught me. And because of this subject, I have learned to take care of myself every now and then.

                <p>Balik Talent Lecture: “Success: Its all about the mindset” <span class="date">8/24/2023</span></p>
                <p>
                    This lecture was held by the CCS Department featuring the speaker, Ms. Louel S. Lariba, who was the systems analyst of
                    a Singaporean company. Her lecture is all about how attitudes that one has developed in the classroom can be brought 
                    over to the workplace, and can contribute to the success or downfall of the person when working in the company. I was
                    the audience there
                    <br><br>
                    This activity helped me understand that habits, particularly the soft skills like being a good listener, 
                    are very important to be developed when we are still in school as we can bring them to the workplace. More over,
                    if we develop our good soft skills, the companies that we work in will trust us more. Even with the high amount of
                    responsibilities that that comes with it. it still means that you are definitely a treasured employee of the business, 
                    and as such, will be able to go up the corporate ladder.
                    <br><br>
                    This lecture helped me understand that developing the right mindset will help me in the long run. Things like listening
                    to the person, asking help from others who have encountered a certain problem that you are facing, being able to 
                    innovate and do more than what you could do, and others are some of the things that I could do to apply to the lecture.
                    <br><br>
                    Because of this activity, I have opened my eyes more to the importance of developing a good lifestyle and habit.
