                <p>Igniting Creativity <span class="date">8/23/2023</span></p>
                <p>
                    This was a limited seating activity held by the CCS Confederate Committee inside the Application Development Room 
                    in the afternoon.
                    <br><br>
                    When I entered there, I was thinking that it would be a workshop or a lecture that helps make our creative juices 
                    flowing. Instead, it was an activity all about playing games. The entire activity was about people playing JackTV,
                    with most of the people there in the back either watching the shenanigans on the big screen in front, or playing
                    something else entirely. Although this was what I didnt really come here for, I still stayed, as I had already 
                    made by attendance before entering. At first, I was shy to join the JackTV game, but then little by little, I 
                    gained my confidence when I was watching them play. It was only then when we turn to the next game when I realize 
                    why it was named "Igniting Creativity". Even if it was just making jokes, it was still igniting the creativity of
                    what we can do, even within the scope of the challenge presented to us by JackTV. Things like making a funny joke
                    out of snippets of a few random words, making a set of short prompts with the fewest words available, or just
                    responding to an interview-like question in a random way are some of the things that they, even I, did. Although
                    we lost to the best joker in the college, Sir Te, at least it helped me understand that there is another side of
                    being creative other than just crafts and drawings.
                    <br><br>
                    This activity had helped me open my eyes to a different aspect to what "creativity" means. I will treasure this
                    learning by not only through drawing and being artistic on something, but also being very smart and witty on my
                    jokes and the techniques that I can apply to the future work that I am in.
                    <br><br>
                    Thus, as what my Dad says, in the hearts of every man or woman, there is a child still lingering on.

                <p>Movie Nights(1-3) <span class="date">8/23/2023</span></p>
                <p>
                    This is an activity that I participated in as part of the assigned Food Committee members who are tasked to sell
                    popcorn and juices to those who are watching the movies every night. The first night's movie was "Spiderman: Across 
                    the Spiderverse", the second movie after "Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse". The second night's movie was "Elemental",
                    a recent movie made by Disney about two different elements, fire and water. And the last night's movie was a 
                    surprising one, but I wont spoil it for you here.
                    <br><br>
                    Although this activity was just merely movie watching, as an avid reader for stories from other people, there are some
                    lessons to be learned here. One is to be able to find one's own identity and appreciate of it, even if other's tell 
                    you that's not who you are supposed to be. Another is that love is boundless, even if one lives on another compared to
                    his/her love. And another is that even on the face of danger, as long as you are together with a person that you love,
                    you can conquer all. Even if people remembers your past as a different person, what you can do for the one you love in
                    the present, is all that matters most. And also that teamwork can make things a lot easier.
                    <br><br>
                    I can apply what I have learned by finding my own identity and my own place in this world. I could also not give up on
                    love, even I am worlds apart from the one that I love by continuing on and cherishing the moments that I have with my 
                    future partner. And even if my past was horrible, I will still try my best to help people to prove that I can change.
                    <br><br>
                    Because of this activity, I had seen a lot of stories in different genres, from comedy, to romance, to downright 
                    terrifying. But even with these stories from different worlds and of different situations, there is still something to
                    learn, and that is one of the reasons why movies like them are still being watched and liked by so many to this day.

                <p>
                    This activity was held by several local artists in Cafe Mugna, where the El Amigos bar is. I was one of the 
                    spectators there in the event.
                    <br><br>
                    This event was very interesting be in. Normally whenever I go in art exhibits, I always see it as just a 
                    collection of paintings of different sizes, most of which are either portraits or landscapes. This is not the 
                    case here, as I was instead visited by a unique cast of colors and flavors and texture. One of them are slippers 
                    made out of clay going from the sandy circle to the walls, while another was a painted wood sculpture that references 
                    Pinocchio and the various social media icons where users there will normally fight over very trivial things, and 
                    another are a series of paintings that depicts lucid and rainbow-like circles. 
                    <br><br>
                    Although these things can have no meaning at all to one, I see them as artworks that can have different meanings, as
                    long as they have the mind to see it. Just like how one interprets life, these artworks that I see before me can
                    be viewed as something, or can be viewed as nothing at all.
                    <br><br>
                    I can try to apply this by changing the way I percieve the situations that I am in. When encountering a problem, I 
                    try to see if this problem is even worth solving with the current abilities that I have. I could also try to change the
                    way that I see my own relationship with my family and friends through the stories I read and the lessons I understand.
                    <br><br>
                    Because of this activity, I am able to change the way that I see the world, not only through one aspect, but by 
                    different perspectives.

                    changes that the judges have given. Yet, even with the different changes that they gave, the groups were able to gain 
                    composure, and even made the plot funnier than before as the competition continued to moved on.
                    <br><br> 
                    Watching this competition helped me learn to revel and go with the changes of the world by adapting and becoming 
                    flexible when situations change.
                    <br><br> 
                    This competition helped me learn what it means to "go with the flow".

                <p>Hari Ng Negros Display Viewing <span class="date">10/13/2023</span></p>
                <p>
                    This is a display for an event about embracing our local culture here in Negros. It was a local modeling competition
                    that was held during Charter Day. Every male models from different parts of the island are competing in this 
                    competition. This was one of the challenges, where their respective skin-painters would try to paint them based on
                    our old folklores, mythologies, or traditions that we have here.
                    <br><br> 
                    This display had caught my eyes, as I was also an avid art viewer and seeing skin art that close was a new thing for 
                    me. Although previously I watched skin-art shows on TV, seeing it a little bit more upclose had shook me more.
                    <br><br> 
                    Although there seems to be no message to be here, embracing one's culture is what the challenge is all about. So, I
                    will continue to do the traditions that my parents had given me. I could also try to partake in any activity that is
                    happening in the community so to understand the culture of the community that I live in.
                    <br><br> 
                    We live in a world where it seems no one embraces the culture that was given to us by our ancestors. Embracing culture 
                    is important. Culture is vital to a person, as it is their identity. It is important to embrace the identity that we
                    have, so that we could really see the problems that we are experiencing in our island.

                <p>Campus Tour <span class="date">10/18/2023</span></p>
                <p>
                    This activity was held by our GE10 adviser in order for us to be more familiar to the campus that we study in. We were
                    grouped in batches, and were assigned a schedule when we will have it. I met with my groupmates in the afternoon under 
                    the shade of the CBA building lobby, and had proceeded to the campus tour when the our campus guide arrived.
                    <br><br>
                    The campus was was really interesting, as there are some facts or rumors that I have not heard of before in some of the 
                    buildings in the campus. When we went to Hibbard Hall, it astounded me that even if the building looked recently 
                    built (like it looked like it was built in the 1980s), it actually stood in the middle of World War 2. Even more 
                    surprising that the Guy Hall, which was where the first male dormitories of Silliman are and is currently where we 
                    held our Chemistry Classes in Senior High, was in fact also used by the Japanese as a torture building used to punish
                    or get more information from their POWs. Even an inactive bomb was left near the premises some years ago. Sometimes 
                    the relics of the past can destroy anyone in its vicinity with a flick of a switch.
                    <br><br>
                    Putting history aside, I was interested that Silliman has their own culture and beliefs. One would be the lighting 
                    up of candles in the Knowledge Gate, and another is hitting the 25 Km/h, all of which are to pray that our grades will
                    get higher.
                    <br><br>
                    Knowing all of these facts, rumors, and beliefs have made me curious on the culture that Sillimanians have practiced and
                    was taught by them by their seniors or kuyas and ates. It taught me that culture doesnt need to be in a community as a
                    whole, it could also be culture shared by the family, with the friends, or in the school.
                    <br><br>
                    Culture is an identity of a person. The culture learned in the community is different compared to culture learned 
                    by the family. And because of this activity, I had opened my eyes to new pespectives of culture.

                <p>Geek Club Society Orientation <span class="date">10/7/2023</span></p>
                <p>
                    This was an orientation made by the Geek Club Society in order to introduce to newbies like me on what Geek Club does 
                    and their subcommittees that helps out with several Geek Society events. However, not only it was about speaking or
                    introducing oneself, but also introducing to them on what their activities can include. I was the audience there.
                    <br><br>
                    I entered the room where the activity was held, expecting a lecture there. Instead, I was visited by an introduction
                    followed by games such as the dancing chairs game and the longest line game. There were also selling of stickers and
                    other products made by some of the members  of Geek Club. I met one who made the sticker that I bought from the stall
                    selling from there. 
                    <br><br>
                    We ended the activity with a karaoke with a bunch of songs that I myself do not know. During this activity, I realize
                    that even how short the orientation is, the games that we had also act as an introduction to each other. We now how
                    each one acts, and how each one's character is.
                    <br><br>
                    Because of this activity, I was reminded that in life, we should have friends, as no man is an island.

                <p>CCS Acquaintance Party <span class="date">9/29/2023</span></p>
                <p>
                    This Acquaintance Party was hosted by our department at night in the elementary school. I helped our Aesthetic 
                    Committee create the photo stand along the hallway. After that, I went to the tables where we are to be seated for 
                    the event.
                    <br><br>
                    This event was just like any event that I had. It had games, food, intermission numbers, and the MCs holding together
                    the flow of the event. 
                    <br><br>
                    After the end of this event, I went back home, as I still have a class to be in early in the morning. But because of
                    this activity, I feel kinda happy and sleepy, knowing that I enjoyed this event.
